# Dotfiles

## terminal
**why ghostty?**
- idk man the config was mad ez and minimal and looks good on mac

## vim 
- i finally decided to make my own nvim config rather than just installing some bloated config i found online (not gonna name any name...)
- it's still a work in progress but its honestly super lightweight & utility focused. (i still did some aesthetic stuff cuz cmon)

## Contributing
- don't!
